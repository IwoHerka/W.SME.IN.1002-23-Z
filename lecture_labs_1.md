		- Introduction and historical context
			- Origins of Erlang
				- Erlang emerged in the mid-1980s from Ericsson, a global telecom giant
				- Pioneered by Joe Armstrong and a team of developers to address pressing challenges in the telecommunications domain, such as the need for robustness, concurrent operations, and system scalability.
				- Functional nature and unique concurrency model, underpinned by the Actor Model, set it apart from contemporary languages and proved transformative for systems requiring high reliability and fault tolerance.
			- The need for Elixir
				- Elixir, a more recent evolution, was developed by José Valim as an attempt to bring the power of Erlang's BEAM virtual machine to a broader audience.
		- Features and properties of Elixir
			- Types of languages
				- Imperative branch
					- Fortran
					- Per-instruction execution
					- Procedural
						- Fortran
					- Object-oriented
				- Functional branch
					- Lisp
					- (a + b / z) -> x
			- Functional
				- Program is a composition of expressions (functions)
				- Immutability
					- An object that can't be changed, and always has the same values from the moment that it is created.
				- Pureness
					- A pure function is a function that, given the same input, always returns the same output and has no side effects.
				- Recursion
					- Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem.
				- Metaprogramming
					- Metaprogramming is the practice of writing code that generates or manipulates other code, allowing programmers to achieve greater flexibility and abstraction by treating code as data.
			- Dynamically typed with type hinting
				- A language being dynamically typed means that variable types are checked at runtime rather than at compile time. In such languages, you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it; the type is determined when the program is actually running based on the value assigned to the variable.
			- Developer-friendly / REPL-driven development
				- Refers to a programming approach emphasizing user-centric tools and environments. It often involves the use of a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), an interactive shell that immediately evaluates and returns the results of code snippets, enabling rapid feedback and iterative experimentation during the development process.
			- Documentation as first-class
				- Signifies the language's emphasis on treating documentation with the same importance as code itself. Elixir provides built-in tools to generate and manage documentation, and its package manager, Hex, natively supports package documentation, ensuring that libraries and modules are easily accessible and comprehensible for developers.
